For Android devices, XMUX depends on Google Mobile Service. You may receive "Platform Exception" related error while signing in if the GMS on your device is not working properly. For most cases, you can follow the instructions to install GMS.

## Enable GMS in MIUI
Most Xiaomi phones have GMS pre-installed in your system. But they are disabled by default. You can try to enable them in Settings>System app settings>Google Service. If you cannot find it, please try to install manually.

## Manual Installation
[Download Go-Installer](https://www.coolapk.com/apk/com.goplaycn.googleinstall) and follow the tips inside the app to install GMS manually.
